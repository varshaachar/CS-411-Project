Idea #1:

The website picks up the user's location, and based on the weather in that area, we will suggest music, food, and movies/TV
shows to watch. In addition to that, we will give the user some activities to do or places to visit near them, in case it is nice
outside. We will use a database (Mongo) to store the user's history. In order to get accurate suggestions, we will take
into consideration the user's gender, age, and so on.
APIs: Weather, Yelp, Spotify, OMDb or The Movie DB.
Third party authentication: Twitter/Facebook

Idea #2:

The website will access the user's individual fitbit data along with picking up the user's location to form workout plans,
meal plans, and suggest points of interest near the user. Since counting the user's steps is a large focus for fitbit and the user,
the suggested points of interest will be based on the user's history that may help them achieve their stepping goal, for example 
a local hiking trail. We will again be using a database (Mongo) to store the user's history.
APIs: Fitbit, Google Maps, FoodCare, 
Third Party authentication: Twitter/Facebook


That's it!

Idea #1:

The website picks up the user's location, and based on the weather in that area, we will suggest music, food, and movies/TV
shows to watch. In addition to that, we will give the user some activities to do or places to visit near them, in case it is nice
outside. We will use a database (Mongo) to store the user's history. In order to get accurate suggestions, we will take
into consideration the user's gender, age, and so on.
APIs: Weather, Yelp, Spotify, OMDb or The Movie DB.
Third party authentication: Twitter/Facebook
